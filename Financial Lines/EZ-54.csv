TC ID,Issue Type,Test Type,Test Case Name,Description,Step Description,Expected Result
AMB-001,Functional,Positive,Verify Combined Aggregate Limit is not displayed for Binder on Coverage Page,"Ensure UI does not show Combined Aggregate Limit field when a Binder is selected","1. Login as a user with binder creation permissions; 2. Create a new Binder (or open an existing Binder); 3. Navigate to Coverage page for the Binder","The Combined Aggregate Limit of Liability field is NOT present anywhere on the Coverage page"
AMB-002,Functional,Positive,Verify absence persists after saving and reopening Binder,"Ensure saving a Binder does not cause Combined Aggregate Limit to appear later","1. Create and save a Binder; 2. Close the Binder; 3. Re-open the saved Binder and navigate to Coverage page","Combined Aggregate Limit is not present after save and on subsequent opens"
AMB-003,Functional,Positive,Verify backend/API does not return Combined Aggregate Limit for Binder,"Confirm API payloads for Binder coverage do not include the combined aggregate property","1. Create or identify a Binder; 2. Call the coverage details API (or relevant endpoint) for the Binder; 3. Inspect the JSON response","Response contains NO combinedAggregateLimit (or equivalent) property for Binder resources"
AMB-004,Functional,Positive,Verify exports/prints for Binder exclude Combined Aggregate Limit,"Ensure reports or exported documents for Binder do not show the field","1. Open a Binder; 2. Generate Coverage export (PDF/print/summary); 3. Inspect generated document","Exported documents for Binder DO NOT contain Combined Aggregate Limit text or values"
AMB-005,Functional,Positive,Verify switching from Policy to Binder hides Combined Aggregate Limit,"Confirm UI toggling between policy-type contexts removes the field for Binder context","1. Open an existing Policy that shows Combined Aggregate Limit; 2. Switch context (or change contract type) to Binder; 3. View Coverage page","When Binder context is active the Combined Aggregate Limit field is hidden; switching back to Policy restores field if applicable"
AMB-006,Validation,Positive,Verify user cannot add Combined Aggregate Limit while creating coverage under Binder,"Confirm 'Add Coverage' or similar flows do not offer Combined Aggregate Limit for Binder","1. Start 'Add Coverage' flow while creating/editing a Binder; 2. Browse available coverage fields/options","Combined Aggregate Limit is NOT available as an input option while Binder is selected"
AMB-007,Regression,Negative,Verify legacy Binder data with Combined Aggregate Limit does not display the field,"Validate system ignores legacy stored combinedAggregateLimit values for Binder UI","1. Seed system with legacy Binder record that contains combinedAggregateLimit value; 2. Open the Binder Coverage page","Even if legacy data contains a value, the Coverage page must NOT display Combined Aggregate Limit; value must be ignored in the UI"
AMB-008,Security/Functional,Negative,Verify unauthorized role cannot enable/display Combined Aggregate Limit for Binder,"Ensure role-based controls prevent adding or showing the field","1. Login as a low-privilege user; 2. Open Binder Coverage page; 3. Attempt to enable or add Combined Aggregate Limit via UI or API","Low-privilege user CANNOT enable or add the Combined Aggregate Limit field; UI/API should reject attempts"
AMB-009,UI,Negative,Verify toggling coverage options does not cause Combined Aggregate Limit to reappear,"Ensure dynamic UI changes do not accidentally surface the field","1. Open a Binder coverage page; 2. Toggle optional coverage switches/checkboxes and change coverage types; 3. Observe UI","Combined Aggregate Limit remains hidden under all toggles and option changes for Binder"
AMB-010,API,Negative,Verify API does not return Combined Aggregate Limit when queried with contractType=binder,"Prevent API regression where unsupported property is returned for Binder queries","1. Call coverage list/detail API with parameter contractType=binder; 2. Inspect response payloads","Response MUST NOT include combinedAggregateLimit property; if present, treat as regression/bug"
AMB-011,Integration,Negative,Verify importing policy data into a Binder does not surface Combined Aggregate Limit,"Ensure import process strips or ignores Combined Aggregate Limit when creating Binder records from policy imports","1. Import policy export (containing combinedAggregateLimit) into a new Binder via import tool; 2. Open the imported Binder Coverage page","Imported Binder must NOT display Combined Aggregate Limit; any imported combinedAggregateLimit values must be ignored or stored in non-displayed audit fields only"
AMB-012,Regression,Negative,Verify legacy/third-party print/export does not include Combined Aggregate Limit for Binder,"Ensure older export code paths do not reintroduce the field in Binder outputs","1. Use legacy export/print feature or third-party reporting that consumes Binder data; 2. Generate and inspect report","Report/print MUST NOT include Combined Aggregate Limit for Binder; presence indicates regression"
